A Quote Generator that randomly generates quotes when a button is clicked. Gives you the qoute itself and who said it.

I stored the each quote and the person who said the quote in an array of objects. Then I set up a random number generator to randomly select an object from the array. When the button is click, the qoute and the person will change.
